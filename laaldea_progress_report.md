# La Aldea SEO Progress Report & Updated Action Plan

## Celebrating Your Progress

Let me start by acknowledging the remarkable improvements you've achieved in a very short time. Your site health has jumped from 89% to 91% according to Semrush, and even more impressively, your AI Search Health has skyrocketed from 89% to 99%. This represents exceptional optimization for emerging AI-powered search engines, which will become increasingly important as tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Google's AI features become the way people discover businesses and services.

The transformation is evident when we look at the specific metrics. You've reduced your crawled pages from 35 to 30, which suggests you've cleaned up unnecessary or problematic pages. More significantly, you've increased your healthy pages from just one to two, while reducing pages with issues from 20 down to 18. You've also completely eliminated the broken page that existed in the previous audit. These changes demonstrate that you've been working methodically through the technical issues, and your efforts are paying off.

Perhaps most telling is the dramatic improvement in your AI search optimization. Moving from 89% to 99% in AI Search Health means you've successfully implemented strategies that help AI systems understand and recommend your business. This positions you ahead of most competitors who haven't yet recognized the importance of optimizing for AI-powered search tools.

## Understanding What the New Audits Reveal

When we examine your latest audits from both Semrush and Ahrefs together, they paint a comprehensive picture of where you stand and what still needs attention. The fact that you're using both tools is smart, as they sometimes catch different issues or present the same problems from different angles, giving you a more complete understanding of your site's health.

The Ahrefs audit for your main domain (laaldeatala.com.uy without www) shows a health score of 49%, which initially might seem concerning. However, this lower score is primarily driven by redirect issues rather than fundamental content or technical problems. Ahrefs found 75 crawled URLs, with 41 internal pages, 2 external links, and 32 resources like images or scripts. Of these, 36 URLs have errors while 34 are healthy. The key insight here is that many of your "errors" are actually redirects that need to be cleaned up rather than broken content.

The www version audit (www.laaldeatala.com.uy) shows only 18 URLs crawled with a health score of 28%, but this appears to be because most traffic and internal linking points to the non-www version. This is actually a good thing, as it means you've chosen one primary version of your site, which is exactly what you should do. The redirects from www to non-www are working correctly to consolidate your authority.

## The Redirect Situation: Understanding the Core Issue

The most significant finding across all your audits is the redirect architecture. Both Semrush and Ahrefs have identified that you have systematic redirects in place, and while redirects themselves aren't inherently bad, the way they're currently implemented is creating inefficiencies that hurt your SEO performance.

Let me explain what's happening and why it matters. When someone or a search engine tries to access your pages, many URLs are going through unnecessary redirect chains. For example, when accessing FAQ pages, the URLs first redirect from the non-.html version to the www version, then back to the non-www version with .html. This means that to reach a single page, browsers and search engines must make multiple requests, which slows everything down and dilutes the SEO value of links pointing to those pages.

The Semrush audit identifies seven incorrect pages in your sitemap that are all redirects. These include your homepage at www.laaldeatala.com.uy redirecting to the non-www version, and several FAQ pages following similar patterns. The Ahrefs audit confirms this with 13 instances of 3XX redirects in your sitemap. This is problematic because your sitemap is essentially a roadmap you're providing to search engines, telling them "these are the important pages on my site." When search engines follow that roadmap and encounter redirects, it creates confusion and inefficiency.

Think of it like giving someone directions to your store, but every landmark you mention has moved to a new location. They'll eventually find you, but the journey will be frustrating and some people might give up along the way. Search engines are similar, they have a limited "crawl budget" for each website, and when they waste time following redirects, they have less energy to discover and index your actual content.

## Your Internal Linking Improvements

You've made significant progress on internal linking, reducing pages with only one incoming link from nine down to five. This is excellent work. The remaining five pages that need more internal links are all valuable FAQ pages that deserve better visibility: your water filtration systems page, renewable energy for irrigation page, pool maintenance guide, hydraulic installations overview, and water pump types guide.

Each of these pages represents an opportunity to rank for important long-tail keywords and to provide helpful information that builds trust with potential customers. When these pages have only one incoming link, search engines interpret this as a signal that they're not very important to your site's overall structure. By adding more internal links to these pages from relevant content throughout your site, you'll accomplish two things: you'll help search engines understand these pages are valuable resources, and you'll make it easier for visitors to discover this helpful information while browsing your site.

For instance, whenever you mention water pumps on your homepage or product pages, you should link to your detailed guide about pump types. When discussing irrigation systems, link to your renewable energy page if you offer solar-powered options. When talking about pools, link to your maintenance guide. These contextual links help both users and search engines navigate the relationship between different topics on your site.

## Structured Data: The Remaining Technical Challenge

Your structured data situation has improved from 73 invalid items down to 21, which represents excellent progress. You've fixed roughly 70% of the validation errors, demonstrating that you understand how to implement and correct schema markup. However, the remaining 21 invalid items still need attention, as they represent missed opportunities for rich results in search engines.

Looking at the specific errors, you have issues with Product snippets on your homepage (four instances affecting one field each), Article schema on several FAQ pages, and Carousel schema across multiple pages. The fact that most errors affect only "1 field" means these are likely small, fixable issues rather than fundamentally broken implementations.

Product schema is particularly important for a business like yours because it can enable rich results showing product information directly in search results, including pricing, availability, and ratings if you have them. When someone searches for "bomba de agua Tala Uruguay," having valid product schema could make your listing appear with additional information that makes it more attractive and clickable than competitors' plain text listings.

Article schema on your FAQ pages helps search engines understand that these are informative educational content rather than just product pages. This can help you appear in featured snippets and knowledge panels when people search for informational queries like "cómo elegir una bomba de agua" or "tipos de sistemas de riego." The Carousel schema allows multiple items to be grouped together in search results, which can be powerful for showing a series of related products or articles.

To fix these remaining issues, you should use Google's Rich Results Test tool for each affected page. Simply enter the page URL, and the tool will show you exactly which fields are missing or incorrectly formatted in your schema markup. Common problems include missing required properties like "image" or "author" for articles, or incorrect data types (like providing text where a number is expected, or vice versa).

## The Text-to-HTML Ratio Warning

Semrush has flagged that your homepage has a low text-to-HTML ratio of only 0.07, which means only 7% of the page's code is actual readable text content, while 93% is HTML markup, CSS, and JavaScript. This can be a concern because search engines need sufficient text content to understand what your page is about and to match it with relevant searches.

However, before making dramatic changes, you need to understand what this metric really means and whether it's actually a problem for your specific situation. A low text-to-HTML ratio isn't automatically bad, it depends on the nature and purpose of your page. If your homepage is designed as a gateway to other sections of your site, with prominent navigation, featured products, and visual elements, it might naturally have less text than an article or guide page. The key question is whether the text you do have adequately describes your business and includes your most important keywords.

Looking back at your previous audit data, I can see that your competitors ranking higher do tend to have more informative content, which suggests that adding more text content to your homepage could help. You don't need to stuff it with paragraphs of dense text that nobody will read, but you should ensure that you have clear, keyword-rich descriptions of your main service categories. Think about creating brief but informative introductions to each section: irrigation systems, water pumps, hydraulic installations, pool equipment, and tools. Each section could have a paragraph explaining what you offer and why someone might need it, naturally incorporating relevant keywords.

## JavaScript and CSS Optimization

You still have 52 issues with unminified JavaScript and CSS files, which is actually slightly worse than the 58 issues in your previous audit. This suggests that while you've made progress in other areas, performance optimization hasn't yet been addressed. These unoptimized files can significantly impact your page loading speed, which affects both user experience and search rankings.

When JavaScript and CSS files aren't minified, they contain unnecessary characters like whitespace, comments, and verbose variable names that make the files larger than they need to be. Every extra kilobyte means more data that needs to be downloaded before your page can render, and on slower mobile connections, this can make the difference between a visitor staying on your site or hitting the back button in frustration.

Additionally, Ahrefs has identified two CSS files that are too large. This is a related issue, when CSS files are both unminified and excessively large, they become a major bottleneck in page loading. The solution involves several steps: first, minify all your JavaScript and CSS files to remove unnecessary characters; second, review your CSS to see if you're loading styles that aren't actually used on most pages; third, consider code splitting so that each page only loads the styles it needs rather than loading everything on every page.

Many content management systems and web hosting platforms offer automatic minification and optimization as built-in features or through plugins. If you're using WordPress, for example, plugins like WP Rocket or W3 Total Cache can handle this automatically. If you're on a custom platform, your developer should be able to implement minification as part of the build process.

## The Redirect Architecture: Your Highest Priority Fix

Based on both audits, fixing your redirect architecture should be your absolute top priority. The redirects are creating cascading problems that affect crawl efficiency, page speed, and link equity distribution. Let me walk you through exactly what needs to happen to resolve this systematically.

First, you need to decide definitively whether you want to use www or non-www as your primary domain. Based on your current setup, it appears you've chosen the non-www version (laaldeatala.com.uy), which is perfectly fine. The key is consistency. Every internal link throughout your site should point directly to this canonical version without requiring redirects.

Second, you need to clean up your sitemap to include only the final, canonical URLs. Your sitemap currently includes www versions of pages that redirect to non-www versions. Instead, the sitemap should only list the non-www URLs that you want search engines to index. This means your sitemap should include entries like "https://laaldeatala.com.uy/faq/tipos-bombas.html" rather than "https://www.laaldeatala.com.uy/faq/tipos-bombas.html".

Third, you need to review all your internal links throughout the site. Wherever you have links pointing to www versions of pages, update them to point directly to non-www versions. This prevents the unnecessary redirect hop and makes navigation faster for both users and search engines. Modern content management systems make this relatively straightforward with find-and-replace functionality in the database, though it's crucial to back up your site before making bulk changes.

Fourth, you need to address the URL structure inconsistency where some pages work with or without the .html extension. Currently, accessing a page like "/faq/tipos-bombas" redirects through www versions to eventually land on "/faq/tipos-bombas.html". You should standardize on one approach: either always use the .html extension or never use it. Then configure your server to redirect one version to the other directly, without intermediate steps.

The specific redirect chain identified in your audit shows pages going through multiple hops to reach their destination. A redirect chain occurs when URL A redirects to URL B, which then redirects to URL C. Each redirect adds latency and wastes crawl budget. You should map out all your redirects and ensure that each source URL redirects directly to the final destination in a single hop.

## Understanding Your Canonical Points to Redirect Issue

Ahrefs has identified 23 pages where the canonical tag points to a URL that itself redirects to another URL. This is a more subtle but important issue that deserves explanation. The canonical tag is a way to tell search engines "this page's content is the same as or very similar to another page, so treat that other page as the authoritative version." It's a powerful tool for managing duplicate content.

However, when your canonical tag points to a URL that redirects elsewhere, you're essentially giving search engines conflicting signals. The canonical tag says "treat this other page as authoritative," but then that page immediately says "actually, I've moved somewhere else." Search engines generally resolve this correctly, but it creates unnecessary ambiguity and can sometimes lead to indexing delays or confusion about which version of a page should rank.

The fix is straightforward: update your canonical tags to point directly to the final destination URL. If a page at laaldeatala.com.uy/example has a canonical tag pointing to www.laaldeatala.com.uy/example, and that www version redirects back to the non-www version, you should simply update the canonical tag to point to laaldeatala.com.uy/example directly. This creates a clear, unambiguous signal about which URL is authoritative.

## Your Nofollow and Noindex Pages

The audits show you have two pages marked as nofollow, two marked as noindex, and two marked with both noindex and nofollow. One of these is your privacy policy page, which is appropriate. Privacy policies typically don't need to rank in search results, so marking them as noindex is a common and reasonable practice. The page is still accessible to visitors who want to read your privacy policy, but search engines won't include it in their index.

However, you should verify what the other noindex and nofollow pages are. If they're pages like terms of service, login pages, or other administrative pages, marking them as noindex makes sense. But if any of these are actual content pages that you want to rank, you need to remove these directives immediately. You should also understand the difference: noindex tells search engines not to include the page in search results, while nofollow tells them not to follow links from that page to discover other pages. Using both together is quite restrictive and should only be done for pages you really want isolated from your site's link structure.

## Performance Implications of Your Current Architecture

Beyond the specific technical issues, your redirect architecture and unoptimized resources are almost certainly impacting your page load times, and page speed is increasingly important for SEO. Google has made Core Web Vitals a ranking factor, which means that if your pages are slower than competitors' pages, you may rank lower even with otherwise excellent content and optimization.

When someone visits one of your FAQ pages, here's what's happening behind the scenes: their browser requests the URL, which redirects to a www version, which redirects back to a non-www version with .html, and only then can the actual page content begin loading. Then the page tries to load unminified JavaScript and CSS files, which are larger than necessary. All of this adds hundreds of milliseconds to your page load time, and in web performance, every millisecond matters.

Studies consistently show that as page load time increases, bounce rates increase and conversions decrease. If your page takes three seconds to load instead of one second, you might lose 30% or more of potential visitors who give up and go back to search results to try a competitor's site instead. For a business website, this directly translates to lost sales opportunities.

The good news is that all of these performance issues are fixable with the right technical approach. Once you clean up the redirects, minify your resources, and ensure every request goes directly to the right place, you should see measurable improvements in your page load times. You can monitor this using tools like Google PageSpeed Insights or GTmetrix, which will show you exactly how fast your pages load and provide specific recommendations for further optimization.

## Building on Your AI Search Success

Your 99% AI Search Health score is genuinely impressive and represents a competitive advantage that most businesses don't yet have. This success suggests you've implemented several best practices for AI-powered search engines. You should understand what this means and how to maintain and leverage this advantage.

AI search engines like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Google's AI Overview work differently from traditional search engines. While traditional search focuses on matching keywords and evaluating links, AI search systems actually read and understand your content in a more human-like way. They look for clear, comprehensive information that directly answers questions. When someone asks an AI assistant "where can I get irrigation systems installed in Tala, Uruguay?" the AI needs to understand from your website what you offer, where you're located, and what makes you qualified to help.

The fact that none of your pages are blocked from AI bots means these systems can freely crawl and learn from your content. This is crucial because some websites inadvertently block AI crawlers through their robots.txt file, making themselves invisible to AI-powered search. You've avoided this mistake, and the 99% health score indicates you're also following other best practices that make your content easy for AI systems to understand and recommend.

To maintain this advantage, you should continue creating clear, informative content that directly answers common questions in your industry. The FAQ pages you've developed are exactly the right approach, they provide detailed answers that AI systems can confidently cite when recommending your business. You should also ensure your contact information, service areas, and expertise are clearly stated on key pages, as AI systems look for this contextual information when matching businesses to user queries.

## Your Privacy Policy Being Blocked: A Non-Issue

Semrush notes that your privacy policy page is blocked from crawling, which they've marked as a "notice" rather than an error or warning. This is actually intentional and appropriate. Your privacy policy doesn't need to be indexed by search engines, as people typically access it through a link in your footer rather than finding it through search. Blocking it from crawling saves crawl budget for more important pages and prevents an unnecessary page from diluting your site's focus in search engines' understanding of what you're about.

However, you should ensure the page is only blocked from being indexed, not from being crawled entirely. Search engines should still be able to see the page exists and follow any links from it, they just shouldn't include it in search results. This is the difference between using a noindex meta tag (which allows crawling but prevents indexing) versus blocking in robots.txt (which prevents crawling entirely). The noindex approach is better for pages like privacy policies because it allows search engines to verify the page exists and follow its link structure while keeping it out of search results.

## External Redirects and Link Management

Ahrefs has identified two external 3XX redirects, meaning you have links going to external websites that redirect to other locations. While this is less critical than internal redirect issues, it's still worth addressing. External redirects slow down page loading when they occur on pages you're linking from, and they can create a poor user experience if visitors click expecting one thing but get redirected to something different.

You should review these external links and update them to point directly to their final destinations. If you're linking to another business or resource, make sure your links go straight to the correct current URL rather than to an old URL that redirects. This also protects you if those external sites eventually remove their redirects, which would turn your links into broken links.

The audit also shows you have pages with nofollow outgoing internal links, and one page with both nofollow and dofollow incoming internal links. Internal links should generally not be nofollowed unless there's a specific reason, like linking to login pages or user-generated content that you don't want to vouch for. Nofollowing internal links prevents PageRank from flowing through your site properly, which can hurt the ranking ability of important pages. You should review these instances and remove the nofollow attribute unless there's a compelling reason to keep it.

## Creating Your Updated Action Plan

Based on this new audit data and the progress you've already made, here's your strategic roadmap forward. I'm organizing this to build on what you've accomplished while addressing the remaining issues in order of their impact on your SEO performance.

Your absolute first priority is fixing the redirect architecture comprehensively. This means deciding on www versus non-www (you've chosen non-www, which is good), updating your sitemap to include only canonical URLs, updating all internal links to point to canonical URLs, eliminating redirect chains by making each redirect go directly to the final destination, fixing canonical tags to point to final destinations rather than intermediate redirects, and standardizing your URL structure with or without .html extensions. This work will improve your site health score dramatically and resolve most of the errors in both your Semrush and Ahrefs audits.

Your second priority is completing the structured data fixes. With 21 invalid items remaining down from 73, you're in the home stretch. Use Google's Rich Results Test for each affected page, focus especially on the Product schema on your homepage as this has the most immediate business value, fix the Article schema on your FAQ pages to enable featured snippet opportunities, and verify your Carousel schema is properly implemented. Once this is complete, you'll have clean, valid structured data that can enable rich results in search engines.

Your third priority is addressing the remaining five pages with insufficient internal links. Create a linking plan where each FAQ page receives links from at least three to five relevant pages throughout your site, update your homepage to link to these comprehensive guides, add contextual links from product pages to relevant FAQ articles, and create a logical linking structure between related FAQ pages. This will help these valuable pages rank better and make them more discoverable to visitors.

Your fourth priority is optimizing your JavaScript and CSS files. Implement minification for all JavaScript and CSS files, review and remove unused CSS rules to reduce file sizes, consider code splitting to load only what each page needs, and enable compression on your web server if not already active. This will improve your page load speed, which benefits both user experience and search rankings.

Your fifth priority is enhancing your homepage text content. Add clear, keyword-rich descriptions for each main service category, ensure these descriptions naturally incorporate your target keywords like sistemas de riego, bombas de agua, and instalaciones hidráulicas, aim to improve your text-to-HTML ratio from 0.07 to at least 0.15 or higher, and focus on content that helps visitors understand what you offer while improving SEO. The goal is informative content that serves both users and search engines.

Your ongoing priority is maintaining and building on your AI search optimization. Continue creating comprehensive, question-answering content in your FAQ section, ensure your service areas and expertise are clearly stated throughout the site, keep all AI search bots able to access your content, and monitor for any new AI search optimization recommendations as this field evolves. Your 99% AI Search Health gives you a significant advantage, and maintaining it will pay dividends as AI-powered search becomes more prevalent.

## Measuring Your Continued Progress

As you implement these improvements, you should track specific metrics to verify your work is having the desired impact. Your site health score should continue climbing from the current 91% toward 95% or higher as you eliminate errors. Your Ahrefs health score should improve significantly once redirects are fixed, potentially jumping from 49% to 80% or higher for your main domain.

You should monitor the number of errors in your audits, working to reduce them toward zero. The current 13 errors in Semrush and 36 in Ahrefs should decrease substantially as you address redirects and structured data. You should track your page load speed using Google PageSpeed Insights, aiming for scores of 90 or higher for both mobile and desktop.

You should monitor your rankings for primary keywords to see if the improvements translate to better positions in search results. Watch for increases in organic traffic as your optimizations take effect, though remember that SEO improvements typically take several weeks to months to fully impact traffic.

You should verify that structured data fixes enable rich results by searching for your business and looking for enhanced listings. Check whether your pages are eligible for featured snippets by searching for questions related to your FAQ topics. These visible improvements in how your site appears in search results will demonstrate the value of your technical optimization work.

## The Path Forward

You've already demonstrated that you can successfully implement SEO improvements by raising your site health from 89% to 91% and achieving a 99% AI Search Health score. The remaining issues are primarily technical housekeeping, specifically the redirect architecture, that need systematic attention but aren't fundamentally difficult to fix.

The redirect situation might seem complex, but it's actually quite straightforward once you understand the principle: every URL should point directly to its final destination without intermediate hops. Your task is to identify all the places where this isn't happening and correct them. This is tedious work that requires attention to detail, but it's not conceptually complicated, and the impact on your site's performance and SEO will be substantial.

As you work through these improvements, remember that SEO is ultimately about creating the best possible experience for your visitors while making it easy for search engines to understand and recommend your content. Every technical fix you implement serves this dual purpose: redirects slow down visitors and confuse search engines, so fixing them helps both; structured data helps search engines display your content more attractively, which helps visitors find you; internal linking helps visitors discover relevant information while helping search engines understand your site's structure; and fast-loading pages with clear content serve everyone's interests.

Your progress so far proves you have the capability to execute an SEO strategy successfully. The roadmap I've laid out builds on that foundation with specific, actionable steps prioritized by their impact on your search visibility and site health. By working through these systematically, you'll build a technical foundation that supports long-term SEO success and positions your business to be discovered by customers searching for irrigation systems, water pumps, hydraulic installations, and related services in the Tala region and throughout Uruguay.
